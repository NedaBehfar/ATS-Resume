#### Summary
After 10+ years of business experience working in sales and marketing, I became interested in how software interfaces can simplify or complicate one’s work. I enrolled at Flatiron-School-Bootcamp, designed apps and graduated recently. I seek new challenges, so I can leverage my business skills and address customer’s pain point.
